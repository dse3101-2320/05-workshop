## Baseball statistics
In this workshop, we continue working on the `Lahman` data sets on baseball players. Here's the database schema, retrieved from the [Sean Lahman's Baseball Database](https://github.com/cdalzell/Lahman?tab=readme-ov-file).

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/Lahnan-db-diagram.jpg")
```

+ Let's load the necessary packages first.

```{r}
# install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, # tidyverse packages
               dbplyr,    # database with dplyr
               DBI,       # Database interface
               RSQLite,   # SQLite package for R
               bigrquery, # Google BigQuery
               Lahman)    # toy data
```

```{r}
# Create and connect to an SQLite database
lite_con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
```


+ We will be using the following tables: `people`, `collegePlaying`, and `schools`.

```{r}
# Copy local data frames to remote database
copy_to(
  dest = lite_con, 
  df = Lahman::People, 
  name = "people",
  temporary = FALSE, 
  indexes = list("playerID")
)
people_db <- tbl(lite_con, "people")

copy_to(
  dest = lite_con, 
  df = Lahman::CollegePlaying, 
  name = "collegeplaying",
  temporary = FALSE, 
  indexes = list("playerID")
)
collegeplaying_db <- tbl(lite_con, "collegeplaying")

copy_to(
  dest = lite_con, 
  df = Lahman::Schools, 
  name = "schools",
  temporary = FALSE, 
  indexes = list("schoolID")
)
schools_db <- tbl(lite_con, "schools")
```

```{r}
# Show available tables
dbListTables(lite_con)
```

### 1. Find all players with first name as "Ken" or "Matty".

```{sql, connection = lite_con}
/* 1. Find all players with first name as "Ken" or "Matty" */
SELECT playerID, nameFirst, nameLast, birthYear
FROM people
WHERE namefirst IN ("Ken", "Matty")
```

### 2. Find all players whose first name contains "mat". Then show the unique first names that contain "mat".

```{sql, connection = lite_con}
/* 2.1 Show unique first names that contain "mat" */
SELECT playerID, nameFirst, nameLast, birthYear
FROM people
WHERE namefirst LIKE "%mat%"
```

```{sql, connection = lite_con}
/* 2.2 Show unique first names with "mat" */
SELECT DISTINCT nameFirst AS Num
FROM people
WHERE namefirst LIKE "%mat%"
```

### 3. Find all players born in Alaska (AK) or Hawaii (HI) after the year of 1980. Order the result by birth year.

```{sql, connection = lite_con}
/* 3. Count all players who were born in AK or HI after 1980 */
/* Order results by birthYear */
SELECT nameFirst, nameLast, birthYear, birthState, birthCountry
FROM people
WHERE birthState in ("AK", "HI") AND birthYear >= 1980
ORDER BY birthYear
```

### 4. Players in the database can attend more than one colleges. Find the last college attended by each player.

```{sql, connection = lite_con}
/* 4. Find the last college attended by each player */
SELECT people.playerID, nameGiven, yearID, collegeplaying.schoolID, name_full
FROM people
LEFT JOIN collegeplaying
  ON people.playerID = collegeplaying.playerID
LEFT JOIN schools
  ON collegeplaying.schoolID = schools.schoolID
GROUP BY people.playerID
HAVING yearID == max(YearID)
```

### 5. Count the number of unique players that attended Rice University.

```{sql, connection = lite_con}
/* 4. Count the number of unique players that attended Rice University */
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT people.playerID)
FROM people
LEFT JOIN collegeplaying
  ON people.playerID = collegeplaying.playerID
WHERE schoolID = "rice"
```
+ Once we are done using a database, make sure to **disconnect** from the connection.

```{r}
DBI::dbDisconnect(lite_con)
```
